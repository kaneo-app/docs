# Quick Start Guide

Get Kaneo up and running on your own infrastructure in minutes.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with Kaneo is using Docker Compose. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:


```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/api:latest
    environment:
      JWT_ACCESS: "change_me"
    ports:
      - 1337:1337
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - .:/app

  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/web:latest
    environment:
      KANEO_API_URL: "https://demo-api.kaneo.app"
    ports:
      - 5173:5173
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Starting the Application

Run the following command in the directory containing your `compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start both the Kaneo frontend and backend. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

Here are the key environment variables you need to configure:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `KANEO_API_URL` | The url of the API | Yes |
