Get Kaneo up and running on your own infrastructure in minutes. Kaneo is an open-source project management tool designed to help teams collaborate efficiently. With just a few commands, you can deploy both the frontend and backend using Docker Compose.


## Installation

<Steps>

1. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml title="compose.yaml"
    services:
      backend:
        image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/api:latest
        environment:
          JWT_ACCESS: "change_me"
        ports:
          - 1337:1337
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
          - .:/app

      frontend:
        image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/web:latest
        environment:
          KANEO_API_URL: "https://demo-api.kaneo.app"
        ports:
          - 5173:5173
        depends_on:
          - backend
        restart: unless-stopped
   ```

2. Run the following command in the directory containing your `compose.yml`:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. This will start both the Kaneo frontend and backend. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Here are the key environment variables you need to configure:

    | Variable | Description | Required |
    |----------|-------------|----------|
    | `KANEO_API_URL` | The url of the API | Yes |
    | `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | Yes |

4. Youâ€™re done! ðŸŽ‰
