Get Kaneo up and running on your own infrastructure in minutes. Kaneo is an open-source project management tool designed to help teams collaborate efficiently. With just a few commands, you can deploy both the frontend and backend using Docker Compose.


## Installation

<Steps>

1. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:
    ```yaml title="compose.yml"
    services:
      backend:
        image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/api:latest
        environment:
          JWT_ACCESS: "change_me"
          DB_PATH: "/app/apps/api/data/kaneo.db"
          RABBITMQ_URL: "amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672"
        ports:
          - 1337:1337
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
          - sqlite_data:/app/apps/api/data
        depends_on:
          rabbitmq:
            condition: service_healthy

      frontend:
        image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/web:latest
        environment:
          KANEO_API_URL: "http://localhost:1337"
        ports:
          - 5173:80
        depends_on:
          - backend
        restart: unless-stopped

      rabbitmq:
        image: rabbitmq:3-management
        ports:
          - "5672:5672"
          - "15672:15672"
        environment:
          - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest
          - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest
        volumes:
          - rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq
        healthcheck:
          test: ["CMD", "rabbitmq-diagnostics", "-q", "ping"]
          interval: 10s
          timeout: 5s
          retries: 5
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      sqlite_data:
      rabbitmq_data:
    ```

2. Run the following command in the directory containing your `compose.yml`:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. This will start both the Kaneo frontend and backend. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Here are the key environment variables you need to configure:

    | Variable | Description | Required |
    |----------|-------------|----------|
    | `KANEO_API_URL` | The url of the API | Yes |
    | `JWT_ACCESS` | Secret key for JWT tokens | Yes |
    | `RABBITMQ_URL` | The url of the RabbitMQ server | Yes |
    | `DB_PATH` | The path to the database file | Yes |

4. Youâ€™re done! ðŸŽ‰
